## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ My name is Julien Gaudin, and Iâ€™m currently working as a Solution Consultant (Pre-Sales).
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about the GitHub ecosystem, for both personal and professional curiosity. 
ðŸ¤” Currently going through the modules from learn.microsoft.com, Iâ€™m looking for help with other content/ real-life examples on how to best use GitHub. 
ðŸ“« How to reach me: via a GitHub discussion

Thanks, and have a great day,
Julien G.
